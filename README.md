# TASK 1 :  PREDICTION USING SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING

**Description** : Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool. Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data. What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

## TASK 2 : PREDICTION USING UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING

**Description** : From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters
and represent it visually. Use R or Python or perform this task. Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

## TASK 3 : EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS : RETAIL

**Description** :Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’
● As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can
work to make more profit.
● What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data?
● You can choose any of the tool of your choice
(Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel/SAP/SAS)
● Dataset: https://bit.ly/3i4rbWl

## TASK 4 : EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS : TERRORISM

**Description** : Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Global Terrorism’
● As a security/defense analyst, try to find out the hot zone of terrorism.
● What all security issues and insights you can derive by EDA?
● You can choose any of the tool of your choice
(Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel/SAP/SAS)
● Dataset: https://bit.ly/2TK5Xn5

## TASK 6 :PREDICTION USING DECISION TREE ALGORITHM

**Description** : Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
● The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to
predict the right class accordingly.
● Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox


## TASK 7 : STOCK MARKET PREDICTION USING NUMERICAL AND TEXTUAL ANALYSIS

**Description** : Create a hybrid model for stock price/performance
prediction using numerical analysis of historical stock prices, and
sentimental analysis of news headlines
● Stock to analyze and predict - SENSEX (S&P BSE SENSEX)
● Download historical stock prices from finance.yahoo.com
● Download textual (news) data from https://bit.ly/36fFPI6
